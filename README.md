# CSV to SRT Subtitle Converter

### 📜 Project Description
CSV to SRT Subtitle Converter is a Python script that converts subtitles stored in a CSV file into the popular SRT format for video players. The script automatically calculates subtitle duration based on character count, ensures appropriate line length, and provides a convenient file selection interface.

### 🎯 Features
- **CSV to SRT Conversion:** Supports CSV files containing subtitles and converts them to SRT format.
- **Convenient File Selection Interface:** Users can easily choose a CSV file to convert using Tkinter.
- **Success Notifications:** The script displays conversion status messages.
- **Subtitle Duration Control:** Considers reading speed and restricts subtitle display time.
- **Line Splitting:** Improves readability by automatically splitting overly long lines.

### 📋 Parameters
- **FRAME_RATE** - The video frame rate for time synchronization (default: 25 FPS).
- **MIN_DURATION** - Minimum subtitle display time in seconds (default: 1 second).
- **MAX_DURATION** - Maximum subtitle display time in seconds (default: 7 seconds).
- **CHARS_PER_LINE** - Maximum number of characters per line (default: 42 characters).
- **READING_SPEED** - Reading speed in characters per second (default: 20 characters/second).

### 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Python Libraries:
  - `csv`
  - `os`
  - `tkinter`
  - `re`
  - `sys`

### 🔧 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/CSV-to-SRT-Converter.git
    cd CSV-to-SRT-Converter
    ```
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x and the required libraries installed.
3. Run the script.

### 🚀 How to Use
1. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```
2. Select the CSV file you wish to convert using the file selection dialog.
3. The script will automatically convert the CSV file to SRT format and save it in the `converted` folder located in the same directory as the CSV file.
4. A success message will be displayed upon completion.

### 📂 CSV Structure
The CSV file should have the following format:
- **Column 1**: Start time in `HH:MM:SS:FF` format (hours:minutes:seconds:frames).
- **Column 2**: Subtitle text.

Example:
```csv
00:00:01:10, Welcome to our video.
00:00:05:20, Today we discuss subtitles.
```

### 🎉 Example Usage
Here's an example of a CSV file and its SRT conversion:
- **CSV Input**:
  ```csv
  00:00:01:10, Sample subtitle one.
  00:00:05:20, Another sample subtitle for the video.
  ```
- **SRT Output**:
  ```
  1
  00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,500
  Sample subtitle one.

  2
  00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,000
  Another sample subtitle for the video.
  ```

### 💡 Notes
- If your video file has a different frame rate, adjust the `FRAME_RATE` value to synchronize times accurately.
- Use the `MIN_DURATION` and `MAX_DURATION` parameters to control subtitle display duration.
